# ARCore Demo

## Introduction
Welcome to my ARCore demo and introduction. I've included the sample code that you'll need, 
as well as a finished version of what we've got by the end of this. ARCore has A LOT of stuff 
packed into it. For this demo, we're just taking a look at the depth and instant placement
features. 

_We will be focusing on using Java for this Demo, instead of Kotlin._

## Building the project
To build the project, you can follow [this guide](https://developers.google.com/ar/develop/java/quickstart)
or clone this repo.

## Run the project
It's important to run the demo project to make sure it's all working, before we start making modifications.
I highly reccomend pluging your phone into your computer and 
[enabling developer mode](https://www.howtogeek.com/129728/how-to-access-the-developer-options-menu-and-enable-usb-debugging-on-android-4.2/). 
However, you can still use and AVD for this. The Pixel 3 XL is on the list of supported devices, so you 
should be fine there.
